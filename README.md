# Telemetry client-server demo

**Please do not clone/push to this repo. If you want to use the code here, either copy it over manually to your own files or fork the repo**.

Don't forget to refer to the [telemetry reading list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gd8ZwtgZqpW9Rrl2viRbKtZ2oJw-afb5Dc_V1xZP23U/edit).

Hopefully by the time we have our project fair everyone will have a basic chat-app like demo that can be shown to people. I'll be updating this repo as we go along, take this as a reference/base-line for what your final project should be. You're highly encouraged (lowkey expected) to extend this and find cool new features to implement (e.g. usernames, timestamps, gui, etc.)
